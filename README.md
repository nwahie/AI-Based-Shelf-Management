To enhance in store experience and optimize the inventory, Retail Stores are going the extra mile to use technology in never before seen ways. Our team is building a platform that can be used to track the in store inventory using Camera Vision and get a strong layer of Analytics that tells in real time the sales performance of the products. We will be using the following AWS tools:
1. Amazon Athena
2. Amazon Rekognition
3. Amazon Tableau
4. Amazon Boto3
5. Amazon S3

The platform will keep track of inventory on the shelf using Open CV and the information will be available on a dashboard in real time. The Analytics layer will have information on time of sales of products, the shelf which led to the sales and sales cycle of the products. This information through dashboard will enable the store management to predict inventory placement and sales and thus optimize the in store inventory.
